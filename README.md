# Transportation Accessibility & Economic Impact in Yolo and Alameda Counties

## Purpose
- Reliable transportation is key to economic stability, affecting jobs, mobility, and quality of life. This project examines vehicle access disparities in Yolo and Alameda Counties, comparing them to California averages to assess how transportation affects housing stability, displacement risk, and inequality. By analyzing differences between renters and homeowners, this study informs policy recommendations to improve mobility for vulnerable groups.

## Summary
- This project uses American Community Survey (ACS) 2022 data to analyze vehicle ownership gaps between renters and homeowners in Yolo and Alameda Counties, comparing them to California state averages.

Findings show Alameda renters face the most transportation challenges, with 16.6% lacking vehicle access, compared to 13.4% in Yolo and 12.1% statewide. Homeowners have lower rates, around 2.6% â€“ 3.1%.

Data visualizations (bar charts, comparisons, and scatter plots) show systemic transportation issues, revealing renters are most affected. In urban Alameda, reliance on public transit increases vulnerability to service disruptions and displacement. In rural Yolo, car ownership is essential, making lack of access a bigger barrier to jobs and services.

Key policy takeaways:
  - Expand public transit in rural areas like Yolo to reduce car dependency.
  - Increase affordable housing near transit in Alameda to improve access for renters.
